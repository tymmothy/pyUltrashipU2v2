This is a Python module for reading data from the USB serial versions of
MyWeigh Ultraship U2 scales (the first version of the scales used a USB HID
interface; this module does not support that version).

Note that it's currently only possible to read the data that is on the first
line of the display, and the user must press the "send" button on the scale
for every reading.  It's unknown whether those are hard limitations of the
scale, or whether it may be possible to add that functionality.

This module requires pySerial to be installed, and a recent (2.6 or newer)
version of Python.  Depending on your operating system, you may also have to
install drivers for the PL2303 USB to serial interface that the scale uses
for communications.

To install:

# python setup.py install


Example:

#!/usr/bin/python

import serial
from ultraship_u2v2 import UltrashipU2v2

device = serial.Serial("/dev/ttyACM0", 9600)
scale = UltrashipU2v2(device)

while True:
    print "%s" % (scale.read())
